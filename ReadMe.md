# XamarinFormsNativeFBLogin

While wanting to implement the Facebook SDK in Xamarin Forms, I couldn't find a single place or example that showed how to use the latest SDK for iOS and Android.

 - https://components.xamarin.com/view/facebookios
 - https://components.xamarin.com/gettingstarted/facebookandroid

There's :
 - https://github.com/IdoTene/XamarinFormsNativeFacebook
 - https://components.xamarin.com/view/facebook-sdk
 
These don't use the latest SDK's provided and kept up to date by Xamarin but were helpful to come to the final solution.
